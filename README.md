## FAQs üìï
* **Why CodeSnap and not Polacode?** CodeSnap allows you to copy the code image without having to save it, which makes it more convenient.
* **Why does this pack not include a theme or icons?** I consider that the theme and icons can vary a lot based on the personal tastes of the developer, this pack is designed for any person and project regardless of personal tastes.
* **Why not include extensions for python, java, javascript or any other language?** This pack is designed for any kind of project, basic extensions for any developer without unnecessary extras, you don't want a bunch of programming language extensions that you don't even use, do you?

## Contribute to this pack ü§ù
* Do you think any of these extensions are unnecessary?
* Do you know of an extension that does the same but better?
* Are there any extensions that you consider essential but are not included?
